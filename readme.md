<h2 style="text-align:center;">Simple Project Using REST API</h2>

---

## How to use?

#### 1.First of all, download the folder with the name `learn-api`.

#### 2.Venv already contains `Django`, `Tailwind CSS`, and `DaisyUI`. You don't need to install them again.

#### 3.And you need to create an API KEY to run one of the programs I created. You can create it here -> https://openweathermap.org/current.

#### 4.And put the API KEY into `learn-api > cat > .env`.

#### 5.And you just have to run the server in your terminal with the prompt `python manage.py runserver`
